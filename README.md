# Productivity Tracker

## Application Overview
A web application designed to optimize daily work schedules. It allows users to track work sessions, rate performance (focus, energy, stress), and visualize efficiency trends over time. The app identifies "Peak Hours" and chronotypes based on collected data. It operates entirely client-side with Local Storage (offline-first).

## My Role
Responsible for the entire product lifecycle: from architecture design to deployment. Utilized AI-assisted development (Cursor) as a productivity tool to accelerate code generation, while maintaining full control over logic implementation, code review, and quality assurance.

## Features

- **Sessions** – Start a timer (e.g. 60 min), rate the session afterwards with sliders: energy, focus, mood, stress, result.
- **Saved check-ins** – All sessions in one list, with bulk delete.
- **Hourly efficiency chart** – Efficiency over time, day by day, with a smooth line connecting data points.
- **Your Insights** – Best hours to work, personalized recommendation, and chronotype (Lion / Bear / Wolf / Dolphin).
